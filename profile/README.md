## Nurtur Team - CH2-PS192 

Hello everyone,

We are a team of seven, hailing from different parts of Indonesia, and we're proud participants of Bangkit Academy 2023 Batch 2. This incredible program is led by some of the biggest names in tech: Google, GoTo, Traveloka, and Dicoding.

To tackle our project, we've organized ourselves into three distinct divisions:

- Cloud Computing: Our cloud team handles all things infrastructure. They build and manage our cloud systems, design the database and API to process data, and serve as the bridge connecting our Machine Learning and Mobile Development teams.

- Machine Learning: The ML division is focused on building the core of our smart technologyâ€”an algorithm that can classify facial emotions from images.

- Mobile Development: Our mobile team is responsible for creating a user-friendly interface for our counseling application.
